# Drawing App

A simple drawing app built using **Python** and **Eel** for the backend and frontend. The app provides a full-screen drawing area with controls at the bottom for selecting brush size, color, clearing the canvas, and saving your artwork as a PNG file.

## Features

- **Full-Screen Canvas**: The drawing area takes up the entire screen, providing a seamless drawing experience.
- **Brush Customization**: You can select the brush color and size using a color picker and slider.
- **Clear Canvas**: A button to clear the drawing area and start fresh.
- **Save Drawing**: Save the drawing as a PNG file directly from the canvas.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend using the Eel library to serve the app.
- **Eel**: A Python library for building web-based GUI applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend for the drawing interface and interactive features.
